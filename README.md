Hello,

This repository is for multiple topics. The topics can be from personal projects to school work.
Those of you who have a link to this repo, feel free to look at all the projects and other task I've been working on.
I'll try my best to make sure the projects are readable and if I feel like it's neccesary, I will expain my coding logic to the best of my ability.
Lastly, feel free to reach out to me with any questions you have about a topic. I'm more than happy to help explain.

Thanks for reading,

-Justaverage
